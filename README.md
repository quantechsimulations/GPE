# GPE
This code simulates the Grossâ€“Pitaevskii equation (GPE) in imaginary time

This code projects the ground state from an initial ansatz by numerically solving the GPE in imaginary time. We consider a systemm  of bosons interacting with a long-range potential of the Lifshitz tipe. It was used for the numerical simulations of Ref. [1]. Refer to this reference for specific detais of the Lifshitz interaction.
